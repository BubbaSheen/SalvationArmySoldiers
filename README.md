# SalvationArmySoldiers
The mission to spread knowledge to members of the Salvation Army about Everglades and Oceanic Conservation Causes.
Conservation comes first.
No need to join if you are scared to get hands dirty. We work hard.
We also know how to play, its not all work.
No profanity.
No Nudity.
Alchohol and marajuana are fine as long as not used in excess.
Dress code will be Camoflauge or Spf type outdoor shirts.
Boots will be required most of the time if we are in the woods or the swamp.
All other times footwear is totally up to the volunteer or employee.
Anyone caught stealing from the environment anything more than photographs from the environments we will work in will be terminated from the organization.
Fishing will often times be permitted as long as rules and state guidlines are followed, theres nothing wrong with keeping a few to eat with the family or others on our camping missions. Just dont keep the whole lake.
Respect and Love for Native Environments is key to our future generations so lets start treating them that way.
